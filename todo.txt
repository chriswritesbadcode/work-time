REGISTER NOT SHOW USER INFO

create user role, not NULL, default agent vs admin
if user role is admin, show admin section instead of userview

FOR USERS
new window title "work times - Fname Lname"
and display all work times (getWorkTimes(int) and getBreaks(String type, int id)) with pagination + an option to select date AND range 

FOR ADMINS
all users in a scroll menu, clickable, and each opens a new window with this info (USE EXISTING getWorkTimes and getBreaks fn from before)
